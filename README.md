# E-Commerce Sales Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing e-commerce sales data to provide actionable insights. The dataset was processed using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques, cleaned, and analyzed to create a comprehensive dashboard. The dashboard includes various visualizations such as KPI's, Line Charts, Waterfall Charts, Bar Charts, Clustered Area and Column Charts, and Pie Charts.


## Key Features

- **ETL Process**: Extracted, transformed, and loaded the data to ensure it was clean and ready for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized data formats.
- **Data Analysis**: Performed in-depth analysis to identify trends, patterns, and key performance indicators (KPIs).
- **Visualizations**: Created a variety of charts and graphs to visualize the data, including:
  - **KPI's**: Key performance indicators to track sales, profit, and customer metrics.
  - **Line Charts**: To show trends over time.
  - **Waterfall Charts**: To visualize the cumulative effect of sequential data.
  - **Bar Charts**: To compare sales across different categories.
  - **Clustered Area and Column Charts**: To show multiple data series in a single chart.
  - **Pie Charts**: To display the proportion of sales by category or region.
- **Dashboard**: Consolidated all visualizations into a single, interactive dashboard for easy interpretation.

## Tools Used

- **Excel**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pivot Tables**: To summarize and analyze large datasets.
- **Charts and Graphs**: For data visualization.

   - Aggregated data for analysis.
4. **Data Analysis**:
   - Used pivot tables to summarize sales, profit, and customer data.
   - Identified key trends and patterns.
5. **Visualization**:
   - Created various charts and graphs to represent the data visually.
   - Designed a dashboard to consolidate all visualizations.
6. **Final Output**: The final dashboard was created in the "Dashboard" sheet of the Excel file.
